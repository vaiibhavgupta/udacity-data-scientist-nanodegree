# Data Science Blog Post
This folder contains Ipython Jupyter Notebook related to Project 1 - Data Science Blog Post - of Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree.

## Project Motivation
As part of Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree, in which I am currently enrolled in, we are supposed to pick a dataset of our choice and perform some EDA to answer few questions of our own choice. I picked up AirBnB's Boston dataset and posed the following 3 questions:
1. What are the factors that justify the high prices of AirBnBs? OR Letâ€™s say, what makes them PREMIUM?
2. What is the difference between amenities offered by AirBnBs in the top 10 %ile and those in the bottom 10 %ile of the price band?
3. What is the best time for being a host at AirBnB?

## Dataset
1. [calendar data](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston?select=calendar.csv)
    - Dataset contains the price and availability of all the listings in Boston on a daily level between Sept 6, 2016 to Sept 5, 2017.
2. [listings data](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston?select=listings.csv)
    - Dataset contains detailed information related to all the listings in Boston between Sept 6, 2016 to Sept 7, 2017.

## Required Python Packages
Python packages required to run the notebook are
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Seaborn

## How to use the Ipython Notebook 
1. Download the notebook into a folder in your local system.
2. Download both the datasets to the same folder where you have downloaded the notebook.
3. Create a virtual environment and install above-mentioned python packages.
4. Activate the virtual environment and start the notebook.
